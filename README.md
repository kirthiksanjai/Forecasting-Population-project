# Forecasting Population Trends Near Nuclear Power Plants

## Introduction
This project aims to predict population growth around nuclear power plants using machine learning techniques. Accurate population forecasts are crucial for urban planning, resource management, and policy formulation. The study uses data from NASA’s SocioEconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) and various machine learning models to achieve high prediction accuracy.

## Methodology

### Problem Identification
Define the problem of forecasting population growth around nuclear power plants using historical data and machine learning techniques.

### Data Preprocessing
- Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and address any outliers or inconsistencies.
- The dataset is sourced from NASA’s SocioEconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct EDA to understand the characteristics of the data, including distributions and potential patterns.

### Feature Selection
Identify relevant features that contribute to population growth prediction and discard irrelevant or redundant attributes.

### Population Prediction Models
1. **Linear Regression**: Predicts a continuous target variable based on input features assuming a linear relationship.
2. **Ridge and Lasso Regression**: Variations of linear regression with regularization to prevent overfitting.
3. **Decision Tree**: Makes decisions by splitting the dataset based on significant features.
4. **Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)**: Fits models iteratively to find the best model in the presence of outliers.
5. **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)**: Models the target variable as a distribution and captures relationships using a kernel function.
6. **Elastic Net**: Combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization for feature selection and handling correlated features.
7. **K-Means Regression**: Clusters data points and assigns the mean of each cluster as the predicted value.

### Ensemble Learning Techniques
1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**: Reduces variance and helps prevent overfitting by combining multiple models trained on different data subsets.
2. **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)**: Sequentially trains models, focusing on misclassified data points to improve accuracy.
3. **Gradient Boosting**: Builds an ensemble of models in a stage-wise manner, fitting new models to the residual errors of previous ones.
4. **Model Averaging**: Averages predictions from multiple models for improved accuracy.

### Dimensionality Reduction
Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features while retaining important information.

### K-Fold Cross Validation
Assess model performance by splitting the dataset into training and validation subsets multiple times to ensure generalizability.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters using GridSearch, which evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameters.

### Data Splitting
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, reserving the testing set for final model evaluation.

### Model Evaluation
Evaluate models using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R2 Score, and Explained Variance.

### Results Interpretation
Analyze evaluation results to identify the best-performing models and understand their practical implications.

## Libraries Used

### pandas
`pandas` is used for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like DataFrames which are perfect for handling structured data.

### NumPy
`NumPy` is fundamental for scientific computing with Python, offering support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions.

### Matplotlib and Seaborn
`Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` are used for creating visualizations. `Matplotlib` is a low-level library for a wide variety of plots, while `Seaborn` is built on top of `Matplotlib` and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

### scikit-learn
`scikit-learn` is a machine learning library featuring various algorithms like classification, regression, clustering, and tools for model selection and evaluation.

### GridSearchCV
`GridSearchCV` is a tool from `scikit-learn` used for hyperparameter tuning by performing an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid for an estimator.
